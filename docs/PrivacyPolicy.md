#Privacy Policy

Last update: November 8 2022

This document explains how we process personal data and how you, as an individual, can exercise your rights.

Overview

Our first objective is to avoid having any personal data at all.  However, given that you use this app to connect to a service provider, you should be made aware that  their privacy policies apply to the traffic you send at said provider. Within the app we don't gather and thus don't process  personal data. There are some corner cases where we do get data, when debugging a demo provider, when you write bug or in support requests.

No Logs

We go by the motto: "No masters, no logs."

No accounts

Thus no email address, no payment information, no account data. Nil.

Debugging and abuse

When you participate in the beta program or use the demo.bitmask.net provider, we reserve the right to occasionally collect some traffic data for development, debugging and abuse reasons. This is limited to:

IP address, country details (derived from IP address), network connection (think of TLS errors or congestion debugging). This data is ephemeral.

Support

Any support or bug requests are outside of the app. When you submit bug reports or give feedback the amount of data stored is what you shared. When this is done over e-mail, we use a third party: Riseup.net. The bug tracker and software development are kindly hosted by riseup as well: 0xacab.org. Their privacy policies apply (https://riseup.net/en/privacy-policy ). Google Play store privacy policy apply when giving feedback through Play Store reviews.

Updates

This Privacy policy may be updated and, in such case, a new version will be published on Bitmasks website.
