0.9.4 June 16th, 2015 - the "fabbutton" release
Bugs:

  users weren't able to know why Bitmask had failed and they didn't
  think of opening the log by themselves.
- Aborting the establishment of a new VPN connection didn't work
  properly, and some users were confused because they wanted to cancel
  the start and Bitmask didn't do it, although the UI stated the
  opposite. That has been improved, detecting the real status of the
  VPN connection much better.

  connect to the VPN anymore.

Features:
- Removed the progress bars that caused confusion in some states (such
  as "Waiting for connectivity")
- Removed the switch button that was not clear enough (some users
  experimented problems with it during connections, staying "on" while
  the VPN was "off", and put an icon with a progress indicator around
  it.

  users were experiencing had already been fixed in the early days of
  the project.
- Optimized the layout to various devices, so that UI remains
  consistent across sizes, screen resolutions...
