0.9.8 - the UI overhaul
Bugs:
- fixes notification channel bug on Android 8+
- fixes Bitmask starting always on restart regardless of the last state before the phone was turned off

Features:
- support for Android's always-on vpn system setting:
    - Bitmask starts the vpn with the last selected profile
    - if no vpn provile is available Bitmask blocks all outgoing internet traffic until
      the user creates a vpn profile or enables unsecured internet traffic
      with a click on a notification
- improved certificate pinning mechanism
- (more to come)

0.9.7 - the maintenance release
Bugs:
- fixes failing login on Android 7.0 and Android 7.1 (Android Nougat)
- switching between different providers was buggy - bitmask selected
  the nearest gateway of all providers ever chosen, now the nearest
  gateway of the current provider is selected
- fixes app crashes on tablets
- fixes major tablet layout issues
- fixes different app crashes during provider set up
- update information in About Page

Features:
- updated ics-openvpn code, incl. openvpn and openssl
- show vpn data throughput and button to disconnect vpn in notification bar
- support for Android O
- enforce TLSv1.2 on all devices
- bitmask honors the default protocol order (udp/tcp) specified by
  the provider
- removes redundant cancellation confirmation dialog - one is sufficient

0.9.4 June 16th, 2015 - the "fabbutton" release
Bugs:
- Show the log window only when a real error happened, since some
  users weren't able to know why Bitmask had failed and they didn't
  think of opening the log by themselves.
- Aborting the establishment of a new VPN connection didn't work
  properly, and some users were confused because they wanted to cancel
  the start and Bitmask didn't do it, although the UI stated the
  opposite. That has been improved, detecting the real status of the
  VPN connection much better.
- If the user doesn't "trust this application", bitmask doesn't try to
  connect to the VPN anymore.

Features:
- Removed the progress bars that caused confusion in some states (such
  as "Waiting for connectivity")
- Removed the switch button that was not clear enough (some users
  experimented problems with it during connections, staying "on" while
  the VPN was "off", and put an icon with a progress indicator around
  it.
- Code tests to avoid this bugs are revived, since some problems the
  users were experiencing had already been fixed in the early days of
  the project.
- Optimized the layout to various devices, so that UI remains
  consistent across sizes, screen resolutions...
- Localized the app to Spanish, and simplified the login/logout
  feedback so that localization can be polished.
- Improved wording, both in Spanish and in English.
- Updated gradle libraries
- Updated ics-openvpn (thanks Arne), from GitHub!
